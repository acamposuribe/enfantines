# ENFANTINES

The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn.

“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.

“Give them almost a "naive" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec

With two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.

Hey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!

# EASY-TO-READ CODE
The “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.

# PRINTING
“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background. Contact me for a white background version of your iteration.
